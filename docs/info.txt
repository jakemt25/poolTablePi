Pool Pi Guidance Info Document

Description:
	- It shall show where the cue ball will go based on where the 
	  pool stick is, including wall collisions, in real time.
		- It may show collisions with other balls eventually.
	- It shall be calibrated to the table
		- It may be calibrated automatically eventually.

In Progress:
	Start the trajectory plotting
		- Find the stick and it's relation to the cue
		- Figure out how to continue that line through the ball
		- How to use physics on that line with the table

How:
  Initially:
	1. Set the playing area manually by clicking points on the table.
	2. After playing area is set, black out anything outside of it.
	3. Convert a frame to HSV, find the cue ball and project a ring around it
	4. Find trajectory of ball based on where cue stick breaks the ring
